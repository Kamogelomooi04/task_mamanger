# task_mamanger

This program would be good for **small** businesses, the program can help the business manage 
tasks assigned to each member of the team.

The program makes use of two text files, one containing all the **details** of the **tasks** & one 
containing the **usernames** and **passwords** of the team members.

The program allows the user to **login in**. Once the user enters their username and password, the 
program will go into the text file containing the usernames and passwords and check if the credentials entered 
by the user are appropriate. An appropriate error message will be displayed to the user if the user enters a 
username that is invalid or if the user enters a valid username but an invalid password. The user will be repeatedly 
prompted until they provide the appropriate credentials.

Once the user has logged in, an option menu will be displayed.

+ register a user (only the admin will have access to this option)
+ add a task (here the user can also edit the tasks)
+ view all tasks
+ view my tasks
+ generate reports
+ display statistsics
+ exit

The user can then choose the option they wish the program to carry out. 

To go get started you can create the two text files suited for your business,
one containig the details of the tasks and the other containing the usernames
and passwords of the members of your team.
After you have sorted that out, push the project to your machine and play around with
the program.:rocket:
